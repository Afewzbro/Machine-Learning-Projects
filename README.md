# My Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects. Here you will find various applications and tools I've developed.

## Harmful Gas Detection
Gas emissions contribute to global warming, posing risks to workers and residents. This project involves using thermal camera inspections to detect leaks of volatile organic compounds, including the greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). It offers a fast, non-contact measurement tool for detecting small leaks from a few meters away and larger leaks from hundreds of meters away. The project enhances safety by detecting leaks in moving vehicles and ensuring compliance with emission standards.

## Delaney Solubility with Descriptors
A project focused on predicting the solubility of compounds using various molecular descriptors.

## Logistic Regression
An implementation of the logistic regression algorithm for binary classification tasks.

## VGG16 Model
A project utilizing the VGG16 convolutional neural network model for image classification tasks.

## CaptureWrite
A tool designed to capture and write data efficiently.

## Flower Type Identification
An application that identifies different types of flowers using image recognition techniques.

## Image Preparation
A project for preparing and preprocessing images for machine learning tasks.

## Leaf Health
An application that assesses the health of leaves based on images, identifying potential diseases or deficiencies.

## Object Classification
A project focused on classifying objects in images using machine learning models.

## Object Detection
An application that detects and localizes objects within images or video streams.

## Playing with Color
A project exploring various techniques and effects related to image color manipulation.

## Plotting Example
A demonstration of different plotting techniques using data visualization libraries.

## Rice Leaf Diseases
An application for detecting and classifying diseases in rice leaves based on images.

## Trees and Random Forests
A project involving decision trees and random forest algorithms for classification and regression tasks.
